{"result": "The Employer Pays Principle is a policy designed to promote ethical labor practices by covering all recruitment costs, thereby ensuring that workers are not burdened with fees that could restrict their financial freedom. This principle is closely related to the issue of identity papers, as it indirectly addresses and negates the need for practices such as retaining workers' identity documents to control their movement. By adopting the Employer Pays Principle, companies commit to a policy that not only facilitates freedom of movement for workers but also establishes a clear stance against the retention of identity papers for coercive purposes. This approach underscores a commitment to ethical labor practices, emphasizing the importance of workers' rights and the elimination of barriers to their mobility and financial independence.", "input": "\nYou are an expert Legal Sociologist.
