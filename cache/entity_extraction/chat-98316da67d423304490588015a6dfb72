Voluntary Prison Labor  \n \nIn line with ILO Guidance, voluntary prison labor may be used in highly supervised situations where \nprisoners have given their consent, are being rehabilitated or trained in preparation for release, and \nthe terms and conditions o f their employment are similar to those of the free labor market.  \n \nThe specific requirements include:  \nâ€¢ Work or service can only be required from prisoners who have been convicted in a court \nof law. Such work or service must be carried out under the supervis ion and control of a \npublic authority, for example the prison administration of a State -run facility. Prison \nworkers must not be hired to or placed at the disposal of private individuals, companies \nor associations. Compulsory work or service by prisoners i s not allowed for private \nundertakings either inside or outside the prison, or within privately administered prisons.  \nâ€¢ Work or service performed by prisoners in a private undertaking must be voluntary. \nPrison workers must give their consent to working for a  private employer without being \nsubject to a threat or penalty, including the loss of rights or privileges within the prison.  \nâ€¢ Conditions for prisoners who have consented to work within private undertakings should \napproximate the conditions enjoyed by free workers. Prison workers should have access \nto wage levels, social security benefits, and occupational safety and health standards that \napproximate a free labor relationship. Reasonable differences in wage levels are \nacceptable based on deductions made for board and lodging.  \n \n8.

PepsiCo compensates our employees competitively relative to the  industry and \nrequires compliance with all applicable local laws governing the payment of wages and benefits.
