-Goal-
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.

-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_type: One of the following types: [Employment Conditions, Freedom of Association, Collective Bargaining, Human Rights Standards, Child Labor, Forced Labor, Human Trafficking, Working Hours, Rest Periods, Workplace Health and Safety, Wages and Benefits, Harassment and Discrimination, Grievance and Remedy Process, Land Rights, Voluntary Prison Labor, International Instruments, Reporting Mechanisms, Operational-Level Grievance Management, Environmental, Health, and Safety Standards, Labor Union, Employment Agreement, Recruitment Fees, Identity Papers, Employer Pays Principle, International Covenant, Universal Declaration]
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- relationship_strength: an integer score between 1 to 10, indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)

3. Return output in The primary language of the provided text is English. as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.

4. If you have to translate into The primary language of the provided text is English., just translate the descriptions, nothing else!

5. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}.
